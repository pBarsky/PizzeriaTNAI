# PizzeriaTNAI
Simple MVC project made during college course on web applications.

## Features
- User registration
   - With email confirmation
- Azure integration
  - DB
  - Deployment
- Product ordering
  - User can browse and order products (pizza in this case)
- Order management
  - User can browse past orders
    - User can check past order details

## [Demo](http://pizzeriatnai.azurewebsites.net/)
Deployed to azure web app service (**free tier** so it does not load very fast, also it does take a while to spin up the instance)

### Attention
The frontend was not our main focus so it is **kind of scuffed** but the app works as intended. 
Also, the registration confirmation mail might be flagged as spam.

### Future
 - [x] slight rework of frontend
